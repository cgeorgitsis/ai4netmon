Networks connected to the Internet to transmit data depend on other networks concluding that their connectivity depends on other networks. The AS hegemony is a score based on BGP data and depicts the importance of an AS. It quantifies the likelihood of an AS lying on paths toward certain destination IP prefixes. We can obtain the scores of all ASes from IIJâ€™s Internet Health Report (IHR) API [Internet Health report](https://ihr.iijlab.net/ihr/hegemony/documentation#REST_API). 
In order to create this dataset, we downloaded the AS hegemony score for each AS contained in our aggregate dataset for the date 2/10/2021.
