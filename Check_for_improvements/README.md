In this file we train standard Machine Learning models in order to 
predict/find the ASNs that will improve more the Internet monitoring.

We use only graph embeddings (Node2Vec, Diff2Vec, NetMF) as features in order to train our Regression Models.

Run the **Ripe_Ris_improvements.py** script in order to obtain the results from our Machine Learning models.
