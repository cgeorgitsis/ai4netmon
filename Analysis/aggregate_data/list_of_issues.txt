ISSUES

### 1: concatenation does not work correctly
DONE
--> was droping the indexes that were not in AS_rank dataset. Fixed in concat in method create_dataframe_from_multiple_datasets()


### 2: t the AS_rank dataset, it does not fill with nan values the columns [longtitude, latitude], but it fills them with zeros
--> the source of problem is probably at the creation of the asns.csv
DONE


### 3: in Datasets AS_rank the README is missing
--> among the other needed info in the README, add also the information about how the .csv is created
--> We would need information about  how to run the js script (and how to install dependencies). However, since all the project is in python, do a  python script to download the data (e.g. use the requests package)

### 4: in Datasets PeeringDB the README is missing
--> in the readme there is only description about the json file downloaded from CAIDA. Add description also for the netixlan.json: where you download it from (in the main Datasets/README.md) and how you download it and what information it contains (in the Datasets/PeeringDB/README.md)

### 5: in Datasets AS hegemony the README is missing. Also the code that creates the csv is missing
--> include all scripts needed to download the data & create the csv

### 6: the method for creating the graphs should be in a different file/folder (e.g., in graph embeddings), and not in the aggregate data

### 7: in Datasets Atlas_probe the README is missing
--> add also the methods/scripts you use to download the dataset 

### 8: Remove from the Datasets/ folder all the folders and files that are not datasets and should not be in this folder:  CAIDA-Impact/, improvements20210601.txt
