ISSUES

### 1: concatenation does not work correctly
DONE
--> was droping the indexes that were not in AS_rank dataset. Fixed in concat in method create_dataframe_from_multiple_datasets()


### 2: t the AS_rank dataset, it does not fill with nan values the columns [longtitude, latitude], but it fills them with zeros
--> the source of problem is probably at the creation of the asns.csv


### 3: in Datasets AS_rank the README is missing
--> among the other needed info in the README, add also the information about how the .csv is created

### 4: in Datasets PeeringDB the README is missing

### 5: in Datasets AS hegemony the README is missing. Also the code that creates the csv is missing

### 6: the method for creating the graphs should be in a different file/folder (e.g., in graph embeddings), and not in the aggregate data
