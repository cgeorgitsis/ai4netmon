AI for Network Monitoring: A collection of data-driven and ML/AI methods for designing efficient Internet monitoring strategies and measurement campaigns

# Problem Statement
- Internet monitoring infrastructure (provided publicly by RIPE NCC, RouteViews and etc) is invaluable for network operators but
currently infrastructure is not uniformly deployed (see Figure above)

# Overview
We will implement feature engineering on heterogeneous data and give them as input to ML techniques in order to mitigate bias in monitoring infrastructure.

# Datasets
We derived our data from different sources such as:
- CAIDA 
- PeeringDB
- Custom Datasets
- BGP messages
- Past Measurments
