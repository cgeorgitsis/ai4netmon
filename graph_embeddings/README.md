# Graph Embeddings
In this section we create graph embeddings based on **AS relationships**. Specifically we use **Node2Vecc algorithm** which extends the random walk with biasing parameters of BFS or DFS parameters. 
Node2vec is a baseline for sequential methods which efficiently trade-offs between different proximity levels. 
Choosing the right balance enables Node2vec **to preserve community structure as well as a structural equivalence between nodes**. 

# NetworkX Library
NetworkX is a Python package for the creation, manipulation, and study of the structure, dynamics, and functions of complex networks. We use the NetworkX library in order to create our graph
that is based on **AS relationships**.
