This folder contains script and data for different use cases.

Use cases:
* **`ripe_ris_subsampling`**: Select a subset of RIPE RIS peers (instead of using all peers), aiming to achieve the same (or similar) measurement goal with less data (i.e., less peers)

* **`bias_in_monitoring_infrastructure`**: Quantify the bias in the monitoring infrastructure (e.g., RIPE RIS, RIPE Atlas) in different dimensions (e.g., network type, network size, geography, topology); see what set of infrastructure is more biased, and what dimensions suffer from more bias.
